Might want to include a repair function if mario is stuck, something like
if stuck, try jumping for a few frames?

Issue - Mario gets stuck at the pipes that require long jumps.
Mutation has a small chance of correcting it because it would need to correct
several specific frames out of 3000.
Fix - ???????

Something that a paper mentioned was to look at the last few genes before mario was terminated
and to specifically mutate those genes
